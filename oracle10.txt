PL/SQL
======
PL/SQL stands for Procedural Language / Structured Query Language.

It is a extension of SQL and it contains following features.

1) We can achieve programming features like control statements ,loops and etc.

2) It reduces network traffic.

3) We can display custom exception/error messages by using the concept of exception handling.

4) We can perform related operations by using the concept of triggers.

5) It compiles and stores PL/SQL program permenent to database for repeated execution.


PL/SQL BLOCK
============
A PL/SQL program is also known as PL/SQL block.

ex:
	DECLARE
	-
	-	-- Declaration Section 
	-
	BEGIN
	-
	-	-- Executable Section 
	-
	EXCEPTION
	-
	-	-- Exception Section 
	-
	END;
	/

	Here '/' is used to submit the PL/SQL program into database.


Declaration Section
------------------
In declaration section, we will declare variables, exceptions , cursors and etc.
It is optional section.

Executable Section
--------------------
It contains lines of code which is used to complete a table.
Executable section contains actual logic.
It is mandatory section.

Exception Section
-------------------
It contains lines of code whic is executed when exception is raised.
It is optional section.

To see the output in PL/SQL we need to set server output environment.
ex:
	SQL> set   serveroutput   on 


Q) Write a PL/SQL program to display Hello World?


	BEGIN
	DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Hello World');
	END;
	/

	Here DBMS_OUTPUT is a package name.
	Here PUT_LINE is a procedure name.



Q) Write a PL/SQL program to perform sum of two numbers?

	DECLARE 
	A number;
	B number;
	C number;
	BEGIN
	A:=10;
	B:=20;
	C:=A+B;
	DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE(C);
	END;
	/

Declaration and Initialization using single line
------------------------------------------------
	Declare
	A number:=10;
	B number:=20;
	C number:=A+B;
	BEGIN
	DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('sum of two numbers is ='||C);
	END;
	/	


Using '&' symbol we can read dynamic inputs.

ex:
---
	DECLARE 
	A number;
	B number;
	C number;
	BEGIN
	A:=&a;
	B:=&b;
	C:=A+B;
	DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('sum of two numbers is ='||C);
	END;
	/


DML operations are allowed in PL/SQL.


Q) Write a PL/SQL program to insert a record into student table?

	DECLARE 
	A number(3);
	B varchar2(10);
	C varchar2(12);
	BEGIN
	A:=&sno;
	B:='&sname';
	C:='&sadd';
	insert into student values(A,B,C);
	DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Record Inserted');
	END;
	/
	

Q) Write a PL/SQL program to update student name based on student number?


	DECLARE 
	A number(3);
	BEGIN
	A:=&no;
	update student set sname='rani' where sno=A;
	DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Record Updated');
	END;
	/


Q) Write a PL/SQL program to delete a record from student table based on student number?

	DECLARE
	A number(3);
	BEGIN
	A:=&sno;
	delete from student where sno=A;
	DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Record Deleted');
	END;
	/

DRL operations are allowed in PL/SQL.

To execute select command in PL/SQL we need to use into clause.


Q) Write a PL/SQL program to display employee name whose employee id is 201?

	DECLARE 
	L_Ename  varchar2(10);
	BEGIN
	select ename into L_Ename  from emp where eid=201;
	DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE(L_Ename);
	END;
	/

Q) Write a PL/SQL program to display employee name based on employee id?


	DECLARE 
	L_Eid  number(3);
	L_Ename varchar2(10);
	BEGIN
	L_Eid:=&eid;
	select ename into L_Ename from emp where eid=L_Eid;
	DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE(L_Ename);
	END;
	/


Q) Write a PL/SQL block to display employee id , employee name, employee salary whose employee id is 205?
	
	DECLARE 
	L_Eid   number(3);
	L_Ename  varchar2(10);
	L_Esal  number(10,2);
	BEGIN
	select eid,ename,esal into L_Eid,L_Ename,L_Esal from emp where eid=205;
	DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE(L_Eid||' '||L_Ename||' '||L_Esal);
	END;
	/


Percentage(%) TYPE Attribute 
============================
It is used to declare a local variable with respect to column type.

syntax:
	variable_name   table_name.column_name%TYPE;



Q) Write a PL/SQL block to display employee id , employee name, employee salary whose employee id is 205?
	
	DECLARE 
	L_Eid   emp.eid%TYPE;
	L_Ename  emp.ename%TYPE;
	L_Esal  emp.esal%TYPE;
	BEGIN
	select eid,ename,esal into L_Eid,L_Ename,L_Esal from emp where eid=205;
	DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE(L_Eid||' '||L_Ename||' '||L_Esal);
	END;
	/


Percentage(%) ROWTYPE attribute
===============================
It is used to declare a local variable which holds complete row of a table.

syntax:
------
	variable_name   table_name%ROWTYPE;

We can't display rowtype variable directly. 

We need to use table_name.column_name to dispaly the data from rowtype variables.


Q) Write a PL/SQL program to display employees information whose employee id is 202?

	DECLARE 
	A  emp%ROWTYPE;
	BEGIN
	select * into A from emp where eid=202;
	DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE(A.eid||' '||A.ename||' '||A.esal||' '||A.deptno||' '||A.job);
	END;
	/


Q) Write a PL/SQL program to display employees information based on employee id?

	DECLARE 
	L_Eid emp.eid%TYPE;
	A  emp%ROWTYPE;
	BEGIN
	L_Eid:=&id;
	select * into A from emp where eid=L_Eid;
	DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE(A.eid||' '||A.ename||' '||A.esal||' '||A.deptno||' '||A.job);
	END;
	/

Assignment 
===========
Q) Write a oracle query to display last three records from a table?

SELECT * FROM (
    SELECT *
    FROM student
    ORDER BY sno DESC
)
WHERE ROWNUM <= 3;
