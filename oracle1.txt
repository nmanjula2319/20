Types of Data
=============
We have two types of data.

1) Unstructured Data 

2) Structured Data

1) Unstructured Data 
---------------------
Data which is not in readable format is called unstructured data.

In general, meaning less data is called unstructured data.

File contains unstructured data.

ex:
	
	302     Lakemba		SYD		NSW		AUS	

2) Structured Data
------------------
Data which is in readable format is called structured data.

In general, meaningfull data is called structured data.

Databases contains structured data.

ex:
	Unit    Locality	City		State		Country
	----	-------		----		----		-------
	302     Lakemba		SYD		NSW		AUS	
	

Oracle 
========
Oracle is one of the database which is used to store the structured data.

It is a product of Oracle Corporation.

It is classified into two types.

			      Oracle 
				|
	|------------------------------------------|
	SQL					PL/SQL
(Structured Query Language)		(Procedural/Structured Query Language)


Client-Server Architecture 
===========================
In this architecture we will see how our data will store from frontend to backend.

Diagram: oracle1.1

FrontEnd
---------
The one which is visible to the enduser to perform some operations is called frontend.
ex:	
	JAVA, .Net, Python, Perl and etc.

Communication Channel(CC)
-------------------------
It acts like a bridge between frontend and backend.
ex:
	JDBC - Java Database Connectivity 
	ODBC - Open Database Connectivity
	PDBC - Python Database Connectivity 

BackEnd
-------
The one which is not visible to the enduser but it performs operations based on the instructions given by frontend is called backend.
 


Management System
=================
Management system is a software which is used to manage the database.

Using management system we can perform following acitivities very easily.

1) Adding the new data 

2) Modifying the existing data 

3) Selecting the required data

4) Deleting the unnecessary data 

DBMS
=====
A database along with software which is used to manage the database is called database management system.

RDBMS
======
If a database is designed based on relational theories is called relational database management system.

ex:
	Oracle, MySQL , SQL Server, PostgreSQL, Sybase, TeraData and etc.


SQL
====
SQL stands for Structured Query Language which is pronounce as SEQUEL.

This language is used to interact with Oracle Database.

It is a case insensitive language.

It is a command based language.

Every command must starts with verb.
ex:
	select,update,delete,insert,merge and etc.

Every command must ends with semicolon(;).

It is developed by Mr.Codd in 1972 (By IBM).

Sub Languages of SQL
====================
We have five sub languages of SQL.

1) DDL  (Data Definition Language)

2) DML  (Data Manipulation Language)

3) DRL/DQL (Data Retrieve/Query Language)

4) TCL  (Transaction Control Language)

5) DCL  (Data Control Language)


1) DDL  (Data Definition Language)
----------------------------------
This language is used to maintain the objects in database.

It is a combination of five commands.

ex:
	create,alter,drop,truncate and rename.


2) DML  (Data Manipulation Language)
--------------------------------------
This language is used to manipulate the data present in database.

It is a collection of four commands.

ex:
	insert,update,delete and merge.


3) DRL/DQL (Data Retrieve/Query Language)
------------------------------------------
This language is used to retrieve the data present in database.

It is a collection of one command.

ex:
	select 

4) TCL  (Transaction Control Language)
----------------------------------------
This language is used to maintain the transaction in a database.

It is a collection of three commands.

ex:
	commit, rollback and savepoint.


5) DCL  (Data Control Language)
-------------------------------
This language is used to control the access of data to the user.

It is a collection of two commands.

ex:
	grant and revoke 



Table
======
Table is an object which is used to represent the data.

A table is a collection of rows and columns.

Oracle is a case insensitive language but the data present in table is a case sensitive.

ex:
	--------------------------------
	NO |	NAME	|	ADD
	--------------------------------
	101|	Alan	|	Texas
	--------------------------------
	102|	Jose	|	Vegas
	--------------------------------
	103|	Linda	|	Florida
	--------------------------------

	Here we have 3 rows and 3 columns.
