Interview Query
--------------
Q) Write a query to display employee information whose comm is null?

	select * from emp where comm is null;


Update command
==============
It is used to update the data which is present in database.

syntax:
-----
	update <table_name> set <col_name>=value where condition;

ex:
	update student set sname='rani' where sno=101;
	
	update student set sadd='delhi' where sadd is null;

	update student set sname='gogo',sadd='pune' where sno=104;

Note:
-----
	If we won't declare where clause then all rows will be updated.
	ex:
		update student set sname='raja';
	


delete command
===============
It is used to delete the records from database table.

syntax:
-------
	delete from <table_name> where condition;

ex:
	delete from student where sno=104;
	delete from student where sname='raja';
	delete from student where sadd='vizag';

Note:
-----
	If we won't declare where clause then all rows will be deleted.
	ex:
		delete from student;
		delete from emp;
		delete from dept;


Interview Queries
=================

Q) Write a query to promote all employees from Clerk to Salesman?

	update emp set job='Salesman' where job='Clerk';



Q) Write a query to increment salary by 1000 whose employee id is 201?

	update emp set esal=esal+1000 where eid=201;


Q) Write a query to terminate all the employees whose salary is greater then 35000?

         delete from emp where esal>35000;


Logical Operators
=================
If we want to declare more then one condition in where clause then we need to use logical operators.

We have three types of logical operators.

1) AND 

2) OR 

3) NOT 

1) AND 
--------
It will return the records if both conditions are true.

Here conditions must be from same row only.

ex:
	
Q) Write a query to display employee information whose employee id is 201 and employee name is Alan?

	select * from emp where eid=201 AND ename='Alan';


Q) Write a query to display employee information whose employee id is 201 and employee name is Kelvin?

	select * from emp where eid=201 AND ename='Kelvin'; //no rows selected 


Q) Write a query to display employees information whose salary is greater then 30000 and less then 45000?

	select * from emp where esal>30000 AND esal<45000;

2) OR 
-------
It will return the records if any condition is true.

Here conditions can be from any row.

ex:

Q)Write a query to display employees information whose employee id is 201,202,203?

	select * from emp where eid=201 OR eid=202 OR eid=203;	 



Q)Write a query to delete employees information whose employee id is 201,202,203?

	delete from emp where eid=201 OR eid=202 OR eid=203;


Q) Write a query to display employees information those who are working as a 
	Clerk, HR and Manager?

	select * from emp where job='Clerk' OR job='HR' OR  job='Manager';

3) NOT 
-------
It will return the records except the condition.

Here '<>' symbol denoted as NOT operator.

ex:
	select * from emp where NOT eid=201;

	select * from emp where eid<>201;
	
	select * from emp where NOT ename='Kelvin';

	select * from emp where ename<>'Kelvin';


IN operator
============
IN operator is a replacement of OR operator.

It will return the records those who are matching in the list. 

ex:
	select * from emp where eid IN (201,202,203);

	select * from emp where ename IN ('Alan','Kelvin','Maria');


Between operator 
===================
Between operator will return the records those who are in the range of values.

Between operator takes the support of AND operator.

In between operator first we need to declare lower limit then higher limit.

ex:
	select * from emp where eid between 201 and 206;

	select * from emp where esal between 10000 AND 30000;

	select * from emp where deptno between 10 AND 30;



Pattern Matching operators 
==========================
Pattern matching operators are used to select the letters from database table.

Pattern matching operators will take the support of like keyword.

We have two types of pattern matching operators.

1) Percentage(%)

2) Underscore(_) 

1) Percentage(%)
-----------------

Q) Write a query to display employees information whose employee name starts with 'L' letter?

	select * from emp where ename like 'L%';


Q) Write a query to display employees information whose employee name ends with 'n' letter?

	select * from emp where ename like '%n';


Q) Write a query to display employees information whose employee name having middle letter as 'l'?

	select * from emp where ename like '%l%';

2) Underscore(_) 
----------------
Q) Write a query to display employees information whose employee name having second letter as 'a' letter?

	select * from emp where ename like '_a%';


Q) Write a query to display employees information whose employee name having second last letter as 'a' letter?

	select * from emp where ename like '%a_';


Q) Write a query to display employees information whose employee name having third  letter as 'l' letter?

	select * from emp where ename like '__l%';

Duplicate table or Copy of a table
===================================
Using create and select command we can create duplicate or copy of a table.

ex:
	create table stud  as select * from emp;

	create table stud as select * from emp where deptno=10;

	create table stud as select eid,ename,esal from emp;

	create table stud as select * from where eid=201 AND ename='Alan';

	create table stud as select * from emp where eid IN (201,202,203);
	
	create table stud as select * from emp where deptno <> 10;
	
	create table stud as select * from emp where comm is null;
	
	create table stud as select * from emp where eid between 201 AND 206;

	create table stud as select * from emp where ename like 'A%';

cl scr
======
	It is used to clear the output screen of SQL command prompt.
	ex:
		cl  scr
