TCL Commands
============
1) commit

2) rollback 

3) savepoint 

1) commit
----------
It is used to make the changes permanent to database.

ex:
	drop table student;
	
	create table student(sno number(3),sname varchar2(10),sadd varchar2(12));

	insert into student values(101,'raja','hyd');

	insert into student values(102,'ravi','delhi');

	commit;

	select * from student; // 2 records 



2) rollback 
------------
It is used to undo the changes which are not-permanent.	
ex:
	drop table student;
	
	create table student(sno number(3),sname varchar2(10),sadd varchar2(12));

	insert into student values(101,'raja','hyd');

	insert into student values(102,'ravi','delhi');

	commit;

	insert into student values(103,'ramulu','pune');

	insert into student values(104,'rakesh','vizag');


	select * from student; // 4 records 

	rollback;

	select * from student; // 2 records

 

3) savepoint 
--------------
It is used to make a logical transaction in a database.

Instead of complete rollback ,we can rollback upto savepoint.

syntax:
	savepoint <save_point_name>;

ex:
---
	drop table student;
	
	create table student(sno number(3),sname varchar2(10),sadd varchar2(12));

	insert into student values(101,'raja','hyd');

	insert into student values(102,'ravi','delhi');

	savepoint sp1;
		
	insert into student values(103,'ramulu','pune');

	insert into student values(104,'rakesh','vizag');

	savepoint sp2;

	insert into student values(105,'Alan','USA');

	insert into student values(106,'Jose','UK');

	select * from student; // 6 records

	rollback to sp2; 

	select * from student; // 4 records

	rollback to sp1;

	select * from student; // 2 records 


Pseudo Columns
==============
Pseudo column means a column which is not real.

We have two pseudo columns.

1) ROWNUM

2) ROWID

1) ROWNUM
---------
ROWNUM always starts with 1 and increment by 1.

ROWNUM values are temperory.

Once the query is executed we will loss the ROWNUM values.

ex:
	select eid,ename,esal from emp;

	select ROWNUM,eid,ename,esal from emp;


2)ROWID
-------
ROWID is a memory location where our records will store in a database table.

ROWID is permanent.

ex:
	select eid,ename,esal from emp;
	select ROWID,eid,ename,esal from emp;
	select ROWID,ROWNUM,eid,ename,esal from emp;


Interview Queries
------------------

Q) Write a query to read first three records from emp table?

	select * from emp where rownum<=3;



Q) Write a query to display 4th record from emp table?

	select * from emp where rownum<=4
	minus 
	select * from emp where rownum<=3;


DCL commands
=============
1) Grant 

2) Revoke 

Schema 
------
	It is a memory location which is used to run SQL commands.

Privileges
----------
	Permissions given to a user is called privileges.
	
	In general, rights given to a user is called privileges.

	We have two types of privileges.

	1) System privilege 
	-------------------
		Permission given by DBA to user.

	2) Object privilege 
	--------------------
		Permission give by one user to another user.


1) Grant
--------
It is used to grant the permissions to the user.

syntax:
----
	grant <privilege1>,<privilege2> to user;



2) Revoke 
---------
It is used to take back the permissions from the user.

syntax:
-----
	revoke <privilege1>,<privilege2> from user;


DBA> alter session set "_ORACLE_SCRIPT"=true;

DBA> create user swami identified by swami;

DBA> create user renuka identified by renuka;


SWAMI>  conn swami/swami (logon denied)

RENUKA> conn renuka/renuka (logon denied)


DBA> grant connect,resource to swami,renuka;

DBA> ALTER USER swami quota 100M on users;

SWAMI>  conn swami/swami 

RENUKA> conn renuka/renuka 


SWAMI> 
create table employees(eid number(3),ename varchar2(10),esal number(10));
insert into employees values(501,'Alan',10000);
insert into employees values(502,'Jose',20000);
insert into employees values(503,'Kelvin',30000);
commit;
select * from employees; //3 records 

RENUKA> select * from employees ; //table or view does not exit


SWAMI> grant select on employees to renuka;


RENUKA> select * from swami.employees;

RENUKA> delete from swami.employees; (insufficient privileges)

SWAMI> grant update,delete on employees to renuka;

RENUKA> delete from swami.employees;
RENUKA> commit; 

SWAMI> select * from employees;

SWAMI> revoke select,update,delete on employees from renuka;

RENUKA> disc  
SWAMI > disc 

DBA> revoke connect,resource from swami,renuka;
