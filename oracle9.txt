View
=====
View is a virtual representation of a data from one or more then one table.

View does not consumes the memory.

View does not have any data.

View will get the data when we execute select command.

A table which is used to create a view is called base table or above table.

syntax:
------
	create view <view_name> as select stmt;

We have different types of views.

1) Simple View 

2) Complex View 

3) With read only view 

4) With check option view 

5) Materialized view 

1) Simple View
---------------
If a view is created by using one base table is called simple view.

ex:
	create view v1 as select * from emp;

	create view v1 as select eid,ename,esal from emp;

	create view v1 as select * from emp where deptno=10;

	create view v1 as select * from emp where ename like 'A%';

	create view v1 as select * from emp where eid IN(201,202,203);
	
	create view v1 as select * from emp where comm is null;

	create view v1 as select * from emp where deptno<>10;

	select * from v1;
Note:
----
	DML operations are allowed in simple view.
	ex:
		delete from v1 where eid=207;

		select * from v1;

		select * from emp;

2) Complex View 
---------------
If a view is created by using more then one base table is called complex view.

ex:
	create view v2 as select e.eid,e.ename,e.esal,d.dname,d.dloc from emp e, dept d
	where(e.deptno=d.deptno);

	select * from v2;


Note:
----
	DML operations are not allowed in complex view.
	ex:
		delete from v2; //cannot delete from view


3) With read only view
----------------------
If we want to create view  by using one base table and DML operations not required then we need to use with read only view.

ex:
	create view v3 as select * from emp with read only;

	select * from v3;

Note:
----
	DML operations are not allowed.
	ex:
		delete from v3;  //cannot perform a DML operation


4) With check option view 
-------------------------
If we want to create view  by using one base table and DML operations are required only if our condition is true then we need to use with check option view.

ex:
	create view v4 as select * from emp where deptno=30 with check option;

	select * from v4;

	insert into v4 values(208,'Alan',45000,50,'Salesman',500); // view WITH CHECK OPTION

	insert into v4 values(208,'Lisa',45000,30,'Salesman',500);	


5) Materialized view 
---------------------
To create a materialized view a table must have primary key.

ex:
	alter table emp ADD primary key(eid);

	create materialized view v5 as select * from emp;

	select * from v5;

	delete from emp where eid=206;
	commit;	
	select * from emp; // 5 records 

	select * from v5; // 6 records 

In order to see the changes in a view from base table we need to referesh the materialized view.
ex:
	exec   DBMS_SNAPSHOT.REFRESH('v5');

	select * from emp; // 5 records 

	select * from v5; // 5 records 


Q) Write a query to see the list of views present in database?

	select view_name from user_views;


Q) Write a query to drop the view?

	drop view v1;
	drop view v2;
	drop view v3;
	drop view v4;


Q) Write a query to drop the materialized view?

	drop materialized view v5;


Merge Command
=============
Merge command is a combination of insert and update command.

student10 table
---------------
drop table student10;
create table student10(sno number(3),sname varchar2(10),sadd varchar2(12));
insert into student10 values(101,'raja','hyd');
insert into student10 values(102,'ravi','delhi');
insert into student10 values(103,'ramana','vizag');
commit;

student20 table
---------------
drop table student20;
create table student20(sno number(3),sname varchar2(10),sadd varchar2(12));
insert into student20 values(103,'Jose','USA');
insert into student20 values(104,'Mark','UK');
commit;

ex:

merge into student10 s1
using student20 s2
on(s1.sno=s2.sno)
when matched 
then update set sname=s2.sname,sadd=s2.sadd
when not matched
then insert(sno,sname,sadd) values (s2.sno,s2.sname,s2.sadd);

select * from student10;
select * from student20;


Sub Queries
============
If we declare a query inside another query is called sub query.

Sub queries are used to select the records based on unknown values.

In sub query, first inner query will execute then outer query.

A query can be nested upto 32 levels.

We have following list of sub queries.

1) Single Row Subquery

2) Multiple Row Subquery

3) Multiple Column Subquery 

1) Single Row Subquery
-----------------------
If a sub query returns only one row is called single row subquery.

ex:
	SQL Query
	----------
		select * from emp where eid=203;

	Sub Query
	---------
		select * from emp where eid=(select eid from emp where ename='Nelson');


ex:
---
	SQL Query
	---------
		select * from emp where eid=201 and esal=9000;

	Sub Query
	---------
		select * from emp where 
		eid=(select eid from emp where ename='Alan') and 
		esal=(select esal from emp where eid=201);


Q) Write a query to display second highest salary from emp table?

	select max(esal) from emp where esal<(select max(esal) from emp);


Q) Write a query to display all employees records whose salary is greater then Lisa salary?

	select * from emp where esal>(select esal from emp where ename='Lisa');


2) Multiple Row Subquery
------------------------
If a subquery returns more then one row then it is called multiple row sub query.

In multiple row sub query , we need to use multiple row operators.

We have three types of multiple row operators.

1) ANY 

2) ALL

3) IN 

1) ANY 
-------
	select * from emp where esal > ANY(select esal from emp where deptno=10);

	select * from emp where esal < ANY(select esal from emp where deptno=10);

2) ALL
------
	select * from emp where esal > ALL(select esal from emp where deptno=10);

		
3) IN
-----
	select * from emp where esal IN (select esal from emp where deptno=10);


3) Multiple Column subquery
---------------------------
If subquery returns more then one column then we need to use multiple column subquery.

In multiple column subquery we will use IN operator.

ex:
	select * from emp where(eid,ename,esal) IN (select eid,ename,esal from emp);

	select eid,ename,esal from emp where(eid,ename,esal) IN (select eid,ename,esal from emp);
