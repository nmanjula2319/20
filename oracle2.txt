To perform any operation on database we need to establish the connection.

Once the work with database is completed we need to disconnect with database.

Various ways to establish the connection with database
------------------------------------------------------
1)

	SQL>connect
	 	username : system
		password : admin 

	SQL>disconnect


2)

	SQL>conn
	 	username : system
		password : admin 

	SQL>disc  
	

3)
	SQL> conn  system/admin 
	SQL> disc 

create command
===============
A create command is used to create the tables in a database.

syntax:
------
	create table <table_name>(col1 datatype(size), col2 datatype(size),........,
							colN datatype(size));

ex:
	create table student(sno number(3),sname varchar2(10),sadd varchar2(12));

	create table dept(deptno number(3),dname varchar2(10),dloc varchar2(10));

	create table emp(eid number(3), ename varchar2(10), esal number(10,2), 
			deptno number(3), job  varchar2(10), comm number(6));


Describe command
=================
A describe command is used to see the structure of the table.

syntax:
	desc <table_name>;

ex:
	desc  student;
	desc emp;
	desc dept;


Insert command
===============
A insert command is used to insert the record/row in a table.

syntax:
-------
	insert into <table_name> values(value1,value2,....,valueN);

approach1
---------

ex:
---
	insert into student values(101,'raja','hyd');

	insert into student values('ravi',102,'delhi'); //invalid 

	insert into student values(102,'ravi'); //invalid 

null
-----
	A null is a keyword which is used to represent undefined or unavailable.
	ex:
	
		insert into student values(102,'ravi',null);


approach2
--------
	insert into student(sno,sname,sadd) values(103,'ramana','vizag');

	insert into student(sno,sname) values(104,'ramulu');


approach3
---------
	Using '&' symbol we can insert inputs at runtime.
	ex:
		insert into student values(&sno,'&sname','&sadd');


commit command
==============
It is used to make the changes permanent to database.

syntax:
	commit;


dept table
===========
create table dept(deptno number(3),dname varchar2(10),dloc varchar2(10));
insert into dept values(10,'CSE','HYD');
insert into dept values(20,'EEE','DELHI');
insert into dept values(30,'ECE','VIZAG');
insert into dept values(40,'MEC','PUNE');
commit;


emp table
==========
create table emp(eid number(3), ename varchar2(10), esal number(10,2), 
			deptno number(3), job  varchar2(10), comm number(6));

insert into emp values(201,'Alan',9000,10,'Clerk',null);
insert into emp values(202,'Jose',19000,10,'Clerk',200);
insert into emp values(203,'Lisa',49000,20,'HR',500);
insert into emp values(204,'Kelvin',29000,20,'HR',900);
insert into emp values(205,'Lara',27000,30,'Manager',500);
insert into emp values(206,'James',42000,30,'Manager',600);
commit;



select command
===============
A select command is used to select the records from database table.

syntax:
------
	select * from <table_name>;

	Here '*' means all rows and all columns.
	
ex:
	select * from student;
	select * from dept;
	select * from emp;

Projection
----------
	Selecting specific columns from database table is called projection.
	ex:
		select sno,sname,sadd from student;

		select sno from student;


In select command we can perform arithmetic operations.
ex:
	select   sno+100,sname,sadd from student;
	select   sno-100,sname,sadd from student;


column alias
=============
A userdefined heading given to a column is called column alias.

Column alias is temperory.

Once the query is executed we will loss the column alias.

	select   sno-100 as SNO ,sname,sadd from student;

	select * from student where sname='ramulu';

	select * from student where sadd='HYD'; // no rows selected 

	select * from student where sadd='hyd';
